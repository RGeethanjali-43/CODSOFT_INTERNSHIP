Dealt with Titanic Dataset and predicted  the Survived and Un survived people using  Machine Learning

In this project I have taken Titanic Dataset to find  people who is survived or not using Machine learning algorithmns, by considering the target(Survived column) 
it is founded this data is a classification problem. And  data includes various features like
Passenger Id, Name, class, ticket, fare, Parch, Cabin and the target is Survived.

The initial step data pre processing, EDA, has been done and made analysis like Univariant(viewed the distributions of the data)
and found correlations and also viewed using heatmap.
Bi variant analysis(Random forest algorithm to see how target and feautures correlation)

Machine Learning algortithms used:
1. Logistic Regression
2. Random Forest
3. Socastic Gradient Descent
4. Gridsearch

Concluding: Accuracy achieved: 0.83(Randomforest and Gridsearch)
